- 👋 Hi, I’m @hvo2906, a self-taught coder.  
- 👀 I’m interested in solving business and everyday problems using the power of computer through programming.
- Please explore my projects on my github. I'd be very happy if you find it useful and eager to have your feedbacks. Thanks in advance!
  - **1st Project**: Get a clear picture of your Shopee historical spending pattern with ShopeeVN Orders Statement! Think of it as your bank statement, but packed with all your SPE orders detail. Easily export your order history to a Excel compatible file (CSV/XLSX) to keep track of your historical spending, then build a budget and maintain financial health. https://github.com/hvo2906/shopee-order-statement
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to capture Generative AI (ie. ChatGPT...) potential to open new opportunities to solve old and new problems, also help me with programming language which I've not had the time to learn properly and deliver what is out of reach for me before. Be able to learn and to contribute is the reason why I started this github.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on utilizing Generative AI for problems in financial services. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have wide range of interested. Sometimes it leads to distraction, but most of the time it brought more happiness and experiences into my life. Learn how to code is one of that happy outcome.
