- 👋 Hi, I’m @hvo2906, a self-taught coder.  
- 👀 I’m interested in solving business and everyday problems using the power of computer through programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to capture Generative AI (ie. ChatGPT...) potential to open new opportunities to solve old and new problems, also help me with programming language which I've not had the time to learn properly and deliver what is out of reach for me before. Be able to learn and to contribute is the reason why I started this github.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on utilizing Generative AI for problems in financial services. 
- 📫 How to reach me: pqhoangvo@live.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have wide range of interested. Sometimes it leads to distraction, but most of the time it brought more happiness and experiences into my life. Learn how to code is one of that happy outcome.
- Please explore my projects on my github. I'd be very happy if you find it useful and eager to have your feedbacks. Thanks in advance!
